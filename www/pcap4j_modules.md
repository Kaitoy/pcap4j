Pcap4j modules
--------------

Pcap4j consists of the following modules:

* pcap4j-core: The core module which includes pcap API wrappers, packet classes, and so on.
* pcap4j-packetfactory-static: [The Static Packet Factory](/www/PacketFactory.md#static-packet-factory) module.
* pcap4j-packetfactory-propertiesbased: [The Properties-Based Packet Factory](/www/PacketFactory.md#properties-based-packet-factory) module.
* pcap4j-sample: The sample module.
* pcap4j-packettest: The module including test cases for packet classes.
  The tests are not run in this module. Instead, they are copied to pcap4j-packetfactory-static and
  pcap4j-packetfactory-propertiesbased and then run in the modules respectively.

To run a Pcap4J application, pcap4j-core's artifact is always needed.

pcap4j-packetfactory-static and pcap4j-packetfactory-propertiesbased are Packet Factory modules.
An artifact of either of them is needed for packet analysis. Without Packet Factory modules, Pcap4J always returns a [UnknownPacket](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/v1/pcap4j-core/src/main/java/org/pcap4j/packet/UnknownPacket.java) object when it captures a packet.
Learn more about Packet Factory [here](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/v1/www/PacketFactory.md).

The other modules' artifacts are not needed when you run a Pcap4J application.
