Pcap4J 2.x and newer
====================

Pcap4J is a Java library for capturing, crafting and sending packets.
Pcap4J wraps a native packet capture library ([libpcap](http://www.tcpdump.org/),
[Npcap](https://github.com/nmap/npcap), or [WinPcap](http://www.winpcap.org/)) via [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna)
and provides you Java-Oriented APIs.

  You can also craft a packet object from scratch.
* Sending packet objects to a real network.
* Supported protocols:
    * Ethernet, Linux SLL, raw IP, PPP (RFC1661, RFC1662), BSD (Mac OS X) loopback encapsulation, and Radiotap
    * IEEE 802.11
        * Probe Request

    * TCP (RFC793, RFC2018, and draft-ietf-tcpm-1323bis-21), UDP, and SCTP (only common header)
    * GTPv1 (only GTP-U and GTP-C header)
    * DNS (RFC1035, RFC3596, and RFC6844)
* All built-in packet classes are serializable and thread-safe (practically immutable).
* You can add a protocol support without modifying Pcap4J library itself.
* Dumping and reading pcap-formatted files (e.g. a capture file of Wireshark).
* [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

How to use
----------

#### System requirements ####

##### Dependencies #####
Pcap4j needs JRE 8+.
And also a pcap native library (libpcap 1.0.0+, Npcap or WinPcap 3.0+), JNA 4+, slf4j-api, and an implementation of logger for slf4j are required.
I'm using the following libraries for the test.

* libpcap 1.1.1
* WinPcap 4.1.2
* JNA 4.1.0
* slf4j-api 1.7.12
* logback-core 1.0.0
* logback-classic 1.0.0

##### Platforms #####
I tested Pcap4j on the following OSes with x86 or x64 processors.

* Windows: XP, Vista, 7, [10](http://tbd.kaitoy.xyz/2016/01/12/pcap4j-with-four-native-libraries-on-windows10/), 2003 R2, 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012
* OS X
* Linux
    * RHEL: 5 and 6
    * CentOS: 5
    * Ubuntu: 13
* UNIX
    * Solaris: 10
    * FreeBSD: 10

Hopefully Pcap4j can run on the other OSes supported by both JNA and libpcap.

##### Others #####
Pcap4J needs administrator/root privileges.
Or, if on Linux, you can run Pcap4J with a non-root user by granting capabilities `CAP_NET_RAW` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
to your java command by the following command: `setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /path/to/java`

#### Documents ####
The latest JavaDoc is [here](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.pcap4j/pcap4j/2.0.0-alpha).
Each version's JavaDoc is on the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22org.pcap4j%22).

Refer to [here](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/pcap4j_modules.md) for information about Pcap4J modules.

Because Pcap4J is a wrapper of a pcap native library, the following documents help you to understand how to use Pcap4J.

* [Programming with pcap](http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html)
* [WinPcap Manuals](http://www.winpcap.org/docs/default.htm)
* [Mapping between pcap API and Pcap4J API](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/api_mappings.md)

You can learn how to write Pcap4J programs from [samples](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/tree/master/pcap4j-sample/src/main/java/org/pcap4j/sample).

Learn more about Pcap4j from the following documents:

* [Learn about packet class](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/Packet.md)
* [Learn about Packet Factory](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/PacketFactory.md)
* [How to add protocol support](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/HowToAddProtocolSupport.md)
* [kaitoy's blog](http://tbd.kaitoy.xyz/tags/pcap4j/)

#### How to run samples ####
See the following examples:

* [org.pcap4j.sample.Loop](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/Packet.md)
* [org.pcap4j.sample.SendArpRequest](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/blob/master/www/sample_SendArpRequest.md)

If you want to run a sample in pcap4j-sample on Eclipse,
add pcap4j-packetfactory-static or pcap4j-packetfactory-propertiesbased project
to the top of User Entries in Classpath tab of the Run Configuration for the sample.

#### How to add Pcap4J to your project ####

* Gradle

    Add a dependency to the build.gradle as like below:

    ```
    dependencies {
      compile 'org.pcap4j:pcap4j-core:2.0.0-alpha'
      compile 'org.pcap4j:pcap4j-packetfactory-static:2.0.0-alpha'
    }
    ```

* Maven

    Add a dependency to the pom.xml as like below:

    ```xml
    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                          http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
      ...
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.pcap4j</groupId>
          <artifactId>pcap4j-core</artifactId>
          <version>2.0.0-alpha</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.pcap4j</groupId>
          <artifactId>pcap4j-packetfactory-static</artifactId>
          <version>2.0.0-alpha</version>
        </dependency>
           ...
      </dependencies>
      ...
    </project>
    ```

#### About native library loading ####
By default, Pcap4j loads the native libraries on the following conditions:

* Windows
    * search path: The paths in the `PATH` environment variable, etc. (See [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d83bc18.aspx) for the details.), and `%SystemRoot%\System32\Npcap`.
    * file name: wpcap.dll and Packet.dll
* Linux/UNIX
    * search path: The search paths of shared libraries configured on the OS.
      (e.g. The paths in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable)
    * file name: libpcap.so
* Mac OS X
    * search path: The search paths of shared libraries configured on the OS.
      (e.g. The paths in the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable)
    * file name: libpcap.dylib

You can use the following Java system properties to change the default behavior.

* jna.library.path: The search path
* org.pcap4j.core.pcapLibName: The full path of the pcap library (wpcap.dll, libpcap.so, or libpcap.dylib)
* (Windows only) org.pcap4j.core.packetLibName: The full path of the packet library (Packet.dll)

##### WinPcap or Npcap #####
There are two native pcap libraries for Windows; WinPcap and Npcap.

The development of WinPcap has stopped since version 4.1.3 (libpcap 1.0.0 base) was released on 3/8/2013,
while Npcap is still being developed.
So, you should pick Npcap if you want to use new features or so.

By default, WinPcap is installed in `%SystemRoot%\System32\`, and Npcap is installed in `%SystemRoot%\System32\Npcap\`.

If you have both WinPcap and Npcap installed and want to use Npcap, you can explicitly specify it by setting `org.pcap4j.core.pcapLibName` to `%SystemRoot%\System32\Npcap\wpcap.dll` and `org.pcap4j.core.packetLibName` to `%SystemRoot%\System32\Npcap\Packet.dll`.

### Docker ###

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/kaitoy/pcap4j.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/kaitoy/pcap4j)

A Docker image for Pcap4J on CentOS is available at [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kaitoy/pcap4j/).

Download it by `docker pull kaitoy/pcap4j` and execute `docker run kaitoy/pcap4j:latest` to start capturing packets from eth0 on the container.

This image is built everytime a commit is made on the Git repositry.

How to build
------------

1. Install libpcap, WinPcap, or Npcap:<br>
   Install Npcap or WinPcap (if Windows), or libpcap (if Linux/UNIX).
   It's needed for the unit tests which are run during a build.
2. Install JDK 8+:<br>
   Download and install JDK 8+, and set the environment variable ***JAVA_HOME*** properly.
3. Install Git:<br>
   Download [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.
   This step is optional.
4. Clone the Pcap4J repository:<br>
   If you installed Git, execute the following command: `git clone git@github.com:kaitoy/pcap4j.git`<br>
   Otherwise, download the repository as a [zip ball](https://github.com/kaitoy/pcap4j/zipball/master) and extract it.
5. Build:<br>
   Open a command prompt/a terminal, `cd` to the project root directory,
   and execute `gradlew build`.
   Note Administrator/root privileges are needed for the unit tests.
